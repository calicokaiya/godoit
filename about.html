        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
            This is a project I made in order to practice and prove my Golang and
            Web Development skills. For this reason, this serves <b>solely</b>
            as a demonstration of what I can do. This project was done in 4 days,
            and hence, there is
            a lot still to be polished. While I would like to work on this project
            a bit more in order to make it usable for end users, there is a lot I
            want to focus on, and not enough time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would very much like to get a job in the field, and I am prepared
            to expand my knowledge through experience. I believe this project is an 
            important part of my job searching experience.
